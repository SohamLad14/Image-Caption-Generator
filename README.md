**Image Caption Generator**

This project combines computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning system. It uses MobileNetV2 as the feature extractor and a custom LSTM + Attention model to generate captions.

Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which contains 8,000+ images with multiple captions each, the model learns to understand visual content and describe it in natural language.

**Key Features**
-Image understanding using pretrained CNN (MobileNetV2)
-Caption generation using LSTM with Attention
-Trained on the Flickr8k dataset
-Streamlit web app for real-time caption generation
-Lightweight and efficient ‚Äì optimized for deployment
-Easy to extend to datasets like Flickr30k or MS COCO
